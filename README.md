# UselessGifTextGifConverter
<h2>Toolkit for modifying gifs and images.</h2>
Currently supporting compression, expansion, creative ascii and color palette conversions.<br>
My objective is to create a simple program which can convert a given image or gif into a limited ascii or pixelart representation using reduced color palettes from archaic computers and video game consoles. While the truth is that I am creating this for my own enjoyment the "intended" user, should one need to be specified, are game development hobbyists looking to more easily convert images into a specialized graphics style evocative of a particular era of technology for the purpose of facilitating <b>new age fun</b> with a <b>vintage feel.</b>
